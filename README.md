# TennisGameScoreTracker
A desktop app to show the score for a single game of tennis.
The software aims to cover all tennis rules and by testing I can see that it does
There is no need to re run the application just hit enter after you see the score on the output to restart the tracker as there is a
while loop to keep the app running
I could not know why who serves the ball matters to this app but it does not seem that it needs to know this info
There are comments across the application to help explain what I was doing
